# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This project
doesn't currently follow semantic versioning, but will once it reaches 1.0.0.

Not every commit needs to result in a change to this file (e.g. docs and chore commits). Every
commit that affects the code in a way that consumers might care about should include edits to the
'Unreleased' section though. Breaking changes should be prefixed with `**BREAKING:**`.
